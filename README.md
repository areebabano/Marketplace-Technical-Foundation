Marketplace Technical Foundation - [Hekto: Building the Future of Furniture Shopping]  🚀

I’m excited to announce that I’ve successfully completed Day 2 of the Marketplace Technical Foundation task as part of my ongoing development journey! 📚✨

For this task, I focused on creating detailed technical documentation that includes:

🖥️ System architecture diagrams
🔗 API endpoint structures
🛠️ Sanity schema for data validation
All files have been organized and uploaded to the "Documentation" folder in my GitHub repository, following the submission guidelines. Additionally, I've included collaboration notes that reflect how ideas were shared and feedback was incorporated within the team. 🤝💬

This task has been an incredible learning experience, and I look forward to sharing more insights as the project evolves! 🚀
