ðŸš€ Building the Future of Furniture Shopping - Hekto E-Commerce Marketplace

Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ve completed the initial phases of building my E-Commerce site, Hekto, designed to revolutionize the future of furniture shopping! Over the past six days, Iâ€™ve meticulously planned, designed, and developed the marketplace, laying a strong foundation for its future growth and deployment.

Key Highlights:

Day 1-3: Focused on foundational planning, technical requirements, and API integration.
Day 4: Developed dynamic frontend components, including product listings, search bar, cart, checkout flow, and wishlist.
Day 5: Conducted extensive functional, performance, and security testing to ensure the siteâ€™s reliability.
Day 6: Set up the staging environment, refined deployment processes, and ensured everything is ready for live deployment.
This project has been incredibly rewarding and provided a great opportunity to apply a wide range of skills, from business planning and technical design to hands-on development. The most fulfilling part was seeing all the components come together, and Iâ€™m excited to continue refining and expanding the platform.

Check out the full documentation attached!

Stay tuned for Day 7, where Iâ€™ll be deploying the marketplace live and sharing post-launch practices. ðŸš€
